<h1>ðŸŽƒ Halloween plugin</h1>
<p>
  Simple plugin that let's you prank your friends with few commands!
</p>

<h2>ðŸ§  Idea</h2>
<p>I will start that this idea is probably someone's else idea. <br />
  I got requested to do a plugin that does all the things that this plugin is doing, but I believe that those ideas were too "planed" to be that person idea, 
  but unfortunetelly I couldn't find the author, so if this plugin remind you of another plugin, pleace contact me and tell me his name, so I can include.

<h2>ðŸ’¬ Language</h2>
<p>
  The code is mostly in polish, but <br />
  all the minecraft commands and descriptions are made in Polish, because this is where I got the request from.
